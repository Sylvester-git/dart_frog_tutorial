#  Key Functions of Middleware in Dart Frog
## Middleware can:

1. Modify Requests before they reach the route.
2. Modify Responses before they are sent back to the client.
3. Handle Authentication & Authorization (e.g., check API keys or JWT tokens).
4. Log Requests & Responses for debugging.
5. Apply Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies.
6. Handle Errors Globally instead of handling them in every route.
